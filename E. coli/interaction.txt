ECK125160717	ECK125140671	ECK120010118	ECK120011222	inhibition				ppGpp and DksA act directly and synergistically to negatively control <i>dusB</i>p transcription <i>in vitro</i>, reducing the lifetime of the competitor-resistant complex with RNA polymerase |CITS:[16885445]|. DksA is required for inhibition of <i>dusB </i>p transcription during mid- and late log growth and in stationary phase |CITS:[16885445]|. DksA negatively controls <i>dusB</i>p for normal growth-phase-dependent regulation of <i>dusB-fis</i>operon |CITS:[16885445]|. Moreover, DksA inhibits transcription, in part by further destabilizing intrinsically unstable promoter complexes |CITS:[16885445]|.
