The regulatory effect of ModE is induced when <i>E. coli</i> is grown under anaerobic growth conditions and when the physiological inducer, molybdenum, binds to ModE and promotes the dimerization of the ModE-Mo complex |CITS: [10446207][10206709][9210473][12583917]|.  The ModE dimer binds two molecules of molybdenum with a <i>K<sub>d</sub></i> of 0.8 mM.

ECK120011224	IHF	13	inverted-repeat	IHF		ECK12	IHF,  <b>I</b>ntegration <b>h</b>ost <b>f</b>actor,  is a global regulatory protein that helps to maintain DNA architecture. It binds and bends DNA at specific sites. IHF plays a role in DNA supercoiling and DNA duplex destabilization and affects processes such as DNA replication, recombination, and the expression of many genes |CITS:[15102446][1447969][11827473]|.<br>IHF is highly abundant in the cell. Its total intracellular concentration varies with growth rate and is higher in exponential phase, with 6,000 dimers per cell, than in stationary phase (3,000 dimers per cell) |CITS:[10515926]|.<br>IHF acts mostly as an accessory factor, stabilizing a correct nucleoprotein complex. For example, IHF was originally found to be required for the site-specific recombination of phage &lambda; with the chromosome |CITS:[6251971]|. For this, IHF stabilizes the bending of the DNA to facilitate binding of the bivalent integrase molecules |CITS:[2544029]|. As another example, IHF stimulates transcription at &sigma;<sup>54</sup>-dependent promoters. Here, IHF acts to facilitate the formation of the loop between the upstream bound activator and the &sigma;<sup>54</sup> holoenzyme |CITS:[2208275][1404379]|. <br>Like HU, IHF plays a role in polyamine-dependent DNA condensation. The binding to low-affinity sites and introduction of sharp bends in chromosomal DNA promote the formation of rod-like condensed structures in chromosomal DNA |CITS:[19132923]|. <br>IHF is a heterodimer consisting of the two subunits, IhfA (HimA) and IhfB (HimD, Hip), that share about 25% amino acid identity |CITS:[3305480]|. The structure of IHF bound to DNA has been solved |CITS:[8980235][9032076]|. It binds tightly to DNA regions of about 40 bp carrying the 13-bp consensus sequence with A/T-rich elements upstream of the core consensus sequence. |CITS:[2205834][2972385][8650000]|. IHF makes no contact with the major groove and only a few contacts with the minor groove |CITS:[2541927]|. Therefore, specificity is believed to be due to the sequence-dependent structural parameters of the DNA, where A/T-rich regions play an important role. The bend angle induced by IHF is approximately 160&deg; |CITS:[8980235]|.<br>IHF is necessary for the induction of arginine- and lysine-dependent acid resistance (AR) via both transcriptional and translational controls of gene expression, as IHF activates expression of a specific set of genes involved in survival at extremely acidic pH |CITS:[24816374]|.<br>	Global Regulator	TFs for DNA-bending	
ECK120011229	FNR	14	inverted-repeat	CRP		ECK12	FNR is the primary transcriptional regulator that mediates the transition from aerobic to anaerobic growth through the regulation of hundreds of genes. Generally, this protein activates genes involved in anaerobic metabolism and represses genes involved in aerobic metabolism |CITS: [12754220][15659690]|. FNR also regulates the transcription of many genes with other functions, such as acid resistance, chemotaxis, cell structure, and molecular biosynthesis, among others |CITS: [12754220][15659690]|.<br>The cellular concentration of FNR is similar under both anaerobic and aerobic growth |CITS: [15547274]|, but its activity is regulated directly by oxygen. Under anaerobiosis, FNR acquires a [4Fe-4S] cluster that causes a conformational change and dimerization of  the protein that causes it to become activated |CITS: [11581261]|. Purification of [4Fe-4S]-FNR in an O<sub>2</sub>-free environment has been described |CITS: [19892202]|. The presence of O<sub>2</sub> results in inactivation of FNR via oxidation of this [4Fe-4S] cluster into the [2Fe-2S] cluster |CITS: [19261852][15547274][9177174]| and the disassembly of the dimer |CITS: [8576252]|. After prolonged O<sub>2</sub> exposure, the [2Fe-2S] cluster is destroyed, and apo-FNR, which lacks an Fe-S cluster, is the primary form of FNR under aerobiosis |CITS: [18055593][14730984]|. Nitric oxide (NO) is also able to inactivate FNR through the nitrosylation of the [4Fe-4S] cluster, although NO is sensed by other transcription factors, and FNR appears only to function as a final safeguard against NO damage |CITS: [23471974][12093725]|.<br>Under aerobiosis, the apo-FNR monomer is exposed and can be degraded by the ClpXP protease |CITS: [16243354]|. Two motifs of FNR appear to be necessary for this degradation, one located  in the N-terminal region and the other in the C-terminal region |CITS: [16243354]|.<br>The activated FNR conformation is able to bind a specific palindromic sequence of DNA  with the consensus sequence TTGATNNNNATCAA |CITS: [11771123][2677602]|. The G and the first T of each FNR half-site appears to interact with FNR residues Glu-209 and Ser-212 |CITS: [2136332]|. FNR activates the transcription from class I and class II promoters, in which the FNR-binding sites are located  around -61, -71, -82, or  -92 in class I  and around -41.5 in class II |CITS: [7592457]|.  In class I promoters the second N and in class II promoters the third N of the consensus FNR site tend to be an A-T |CITS: [12706827]|.<br>During activation, three activating regions (AR) are surface exposed for contact with the polymerase and promote transcription. The AR1 region contacts with the &alpha; subunit |CITS: [10972822]|, the AR2 region makes contact with the &sigma;<sup>70</sup> |CITS: [12374818]|, and the AR3 contacts the &alpha; NTD of the RNA polymerase |CITS: [11786011]|. The group amino acids Thr-118 with Ser-187; Lys-49 with Lys50; and Asp86 and Ile81 with Gly-85 are important for AR1, AR2, and AR3, respectively, to make contact with the RNA polymerase |CITS: [10972822][12374818][11786011]|. The monomer in the FNR dimer that makes contact with the RNA polymerase and the activating region in FNR that makes the contact depends on the class of promoter, class I or class II |CITS: [10972822][12374818][11786011]|.<br>FNR belongs to the CRP/FNR superfamily of transcription factors whose members are widely distributed in bacteria |CITS: [14638413]|.  These proteins have an N-terminal sensory domain, a C-terminal helix-turn-helix DNA-binding domain, and a dimerization motif in between |CITS: [14638413]|. The sensory domain of FNR contains five cysteine residues, four of which are essential for linking the [4Fe-4S] cluster |CITS: [8497198]|. <br>Under anaerobic growth conditions, transcription of the <i>fnr</i> gene is negatively autoregulated |CITS: [17293415]|.<br>FNR was named for the mutant defect in  <b>f</b>umarate and <b>n</b>itrate <b>r</b>eduction  |CITS: [796407]|.<br>A new variant of FNR, (FNRD154A)<sub>2</sub>, was used to identify FNR interactions on the <i>ydfZ</i> promoter region |CITS: [22326866]|.  (FNRD154A)<sub>2</sub> also recognizes an FNR-dependent promoter under aerobic conditions and maintains its promoter specificity and conformational stability.  This variant was designed with enhanced stability to O<sub>2</sub>.  It could have a major impact on <i>in vitro</i> verification of the vast numbers of previously unrecognized genes in the FNR regulon, especially in genomic studies |CITS: [22326866]|.<br>Reviews: |CITS: [18433630][14638413][9990723][11931557][19246238]|	Global Regulator	Using internal synthesized signals

CRP is a homodimer and consists of two domains connected by a short hinge region. The C-terminal &alpha;-helical DNA-binding domain carries a characteristic helix-turn-helix motif. It dimerizes in apo-CRP, with the DNA recognition helix F buried within its core |CITS: [19805344]|. The N-terminal dimerization domain mainly consists of &beta;-sheets and carries a hydrophobic pocket for binding of cAMP. A long &alpha;-helix, termed the C-helix, forms an intersubunit coiled-coil. This helix plays a central role in the allosteric activation of CRP. Allostery arises as a natural consequence of changes in global low-frequency protein fluctuations on ligand binding, and there are conserved residues crucial for allosteric control |CITS: [24058293]|. After binding of cAMP, the signal is propagated through a lengthening and reorientation of the C-helix to the DNA-binding domain, resulting in the liberation of the DNA recognition helix |CITS: [19359484][19805344]|.<br><b>Mechanism of transcriptional regulation</b><br>CRP binds to a 22-bp symmetrical site |CITS: [2557589]| and induces a severe bend upon binding, with an angle of ~80&deg; |CITS: [1653449][8757802][6323997][11724533]|. Two regions of CRP, AR1 ( activation region 1 ), located in the C-terminal domain |CITS: [8392187][7966284]|, and AR2 |CITS: [8978616]|, located in the N-terminal domain, are known to interact with RNA polymerase (RNAP). <br>Promoters that are activated by cAMP-CRP can be grouped into three classes, termed class I, class II, and class III promoters |CITS: [10550204]|. Class I- and class II-dependent promoters require one cAMP-CRP for activation and have a single DNA-binding site located upstream of the RNAP-binding site, centered near position -93, -83, -72, or -62 of class I promoters |CITS: [2173826][2167178][12023077]| and overlapping the RNAP-binding site of class II promoters |CITS: [10550204]|. At class I promoters, AR1 of the downstream subunit of the CRP dimer interacts with the &alpha;-CTD of RNAP |CITS: [7925296]|, thereby increasing the affinity of RNAP for the promoter DNA |CITS: [1646077][8735277][8394979]|.<br>Class II-dependent promoters require AR1 of the upstream subunit and AR2 of the downstream subunit of CRP. AR1 recruits &alpha;-CTD to the DNA region upstream of the bound CRP dimer, while AR2 interacts with &alpha;-NTD of RNAP |CITS: [8735277][8978616][9628879]|. Class III promoters require multiple activator molecules, that is, either two or more CAP dimers or one CRP dimer and additional activator proteins synergistically activate transcription |CITS: [15063844][12923087]|. Dependent on the localization of its binding site, CRP functions by a class I or class II mechanism at class III promoters or by a more complex mechanism which can involve direct interactions with the second activator |CITS: [10760178][11742992][16166533]|, or CRP exerts its function by DNA bending |CITS: [8735277][10550204][1848302]|.<br>CRP represses transcription by promoter occlusion |CITS:[8394684]|, by exclusion of an activator protein |CITS: [2454912]|, through the interaction with a repressor protein in an antiactivation mechanism |CITS: [8394345][8736525][17158559][8969182]| or by hindering promoter clearance |CITS: [15385551][10760580]|.  <br><b>Catabolite repression and inducer exclusion</b><br>Catabolite repression in <i>E. coli</i> is mediated by the interplay of CRP, adenylate cyclase, cAMP, and the glucose-specific enzyme IIA (EIIA<sup>Glc</sup>) of the phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase system |CITS: [18359269][17158705][18628769]|. Catabolite repression by cAMP/CRP regulates the total carbon uptake flux through a negative feedback loop |CITS:[25862745]|. In the absence of rapidly metabolizable carbon sources, such as glucose, EIIA<sup>Glc</sup> is phosphorylated |CITS: [9822815]| and activates adenylate cyclase |CITS: [6245052][9457881]|, resulting in an elevated level of cAMP |CITS: [16407219][17675376]|. Due to the autoregulation of <i>crp</i> |CITS: [6297782][7518773][1328816]|, cAMP-CRP levels increase. In addition, in the presence of unphosphorylated EIIA<sup>Glc</sup>, inducer is transported into the cell, leading to the inactivation of the corresponding repressor molecules |CITS: [2651862]|[<b>Magasanik70</b>*]. Therefore, transcription of catabolic genes is switched on by cAMP-CRP.<br>If glucose is available, EIIA<sup>Glc</sup> is predominantly dephosphorylated |CITS: [9822815]|. As a consequence, adenylate cyclase is not activated, resulting in a reduced level of cAMP. Due to the autoregulation of <i>crp</i>, cAMP-CRP levels decrease |CITS: [1715982]|. In addition, EIIA<sup>Glc</sup> blocks the uptake of inducer by blocking the transport systems ( inducer exclusion ) |CITS: [16453452][7041121][7040431][11969416]|. Thus, transcription of catabolic genes is switched off. cAMP not only mediates carbon metabolism but also plays a physiological role to ensure that proteomic resources are spent on distinct metabolic pathways as needed in different nutrient environments |CITS: [23925119]|. &alpha;-Keto-acids inhibit cAMP production |CITS: [23925119]|. <br>CRP has been adapted to respond to different external and internal stimuli according to the particular ecological niches occupied by the bacterium |CITS: [24509484]|. CRP has an important role during growth at low temperatures |CITS:[25637299]|.<br><b>Mutants</b><br>CRP was engineered to prove the enhanced strain osmotolerance phenotype based on several random mutagenesis studies. All variants showed much higher osmotolerance towards NaCl and others osmotic stressors, such as KCl, glucose, and sucrose, than the wild type |CITS: [22179860]|. Using DNA microarray analysis, genes involved in colonic acid biosynthesis were identified as upregulated in the absence of salt stress, whereas carbohydrate metabolism genes were differentially expressed under NaCl stress in an MT6 (CRP mutant with the best osmotolerance towards NaCl) mutant compared to the wild type |CITS: [22179860]|.<br>Magasanik: doi:10.1101/087969100.1.189<br>*Magasanik, 1970.

ECK120011250	CadC		inverted-repeat	OmpR		ECK12	CadC is a metal-sensitive transcriptional activator that regulates the expression of genes involved in cadaverine synthesis and excretion under low external pH and high concentrations of lysine |CITS:[1370290][8195083][16491024]|.<br>Two binding sites for CadC, Cad1 and Cad2, have been determined in the <i>cadBA</i> operon. While Cad1 contains an inverted repeat sequence, Cad2 lacks either an inverted repeat or a palindromic sequence. Both binding sites are necessary for <i>cadBA</i> activation. Under aerobic conditions, H-NS represses the <i>cadBA</i> operon. Upon binding to Cad1, CadC releases the bound H-NS molecules, dissolving the H-NS repressor complex and allowing RNA polymerase binding. Transcription of <i>cadBA</i> is finally activated once a molecule of CadC binds to Cad2 |CITS:[16491024]|.<br>CadC is an integral membrane protein that belongs to the ToxR-like family of transcriptional activators. It features a cytoplasmic DNA-binding N-terminal domain, a transmembrane domain, and a periplasmic C-terminal domain |CITS:[16491024]|. Based on two-hybrid analysis, CadC forms stable dimers in a stimulus- and linker-dependent manner, interacting only at pH 6.8; in addition, lysine is required for transducing the pH-dependent response of the periplasmic sensor into a structural rearrangement that facilitates dimerization of the cytoplasmic CadC DNA-binding domain |CITS: [25979249]|.<br>In the absence of lysine, LysP regulates CadC negatively |CITS:[8195083]|. This inhibition is through intramembrane and perisplasmic contacts under noninducing conditions. Based on site-directed mutagenesis, Asp275 and Asp278 in LysP and Arg265 and Arg268 in CadC were identified as residues for the stimulus-dependent interaction between them |CITS:[24056175]|.<br>LysP and CadC interact most strongly at pH7.6 and at lysine concentrations of 1 &micro;M or less, that is, under non-Cad-inducing conditions. This interaction is attenuated under Cad-inducing conditions (low pH, increased lysine levels). The LysP-CadC interaction is mediated via trans-membrane and periplasmic contacts |CITS: [24056175]|. Oligomerization of LysP is induced at low pH |CITS: [24056175]|. LysP is a trigger transporter |CITS: [19708919]|, i.e., a protein that combines regulation and transport functions within the one polypeptide.<br>At neutral cytoplasmic pH,  a disulfide bond is formed in the periplasmic domain of CadC to inactivate it. At low pH, formation  of the disulfide bond is prevented, which in turn converts CadC into an active state, but only if lysine is present to inactivate to LysP, the negative regulator  of CadC |CITS:[ 21486484]|.<br>	Local Regulator	External sensing using transported metabolites

These genes are coupled to the nitrogen regulatory (Ntr) system, which is &sigma;<sup>54</sup> dependent, through Nac, whose transcription is activated by NtrC |CITS:[9495755]|. Using DNA microarray analyses, it was shown that Nac could affect the expression of 25 genes |CITS:[11121068]|. This transcriptional regulator is negatively autoregulated |CITS:[9495755]| and is expressed under nitrogen-limiting conditions |CITS:[9785451]|.<br>Nac belongs to the LysR family |CITS:[9495755]| and features a helix-turn-helix motif located close to the N terminus |CITS:[9922258]|.

ECK120011294	H-NS	15	inverted-repeat	HNS		ECK12	The H-NS protein, for  <b>H</b>istone-like <b>n</b>ucleoid <b>s</b>tructuring protein,  is a nucleoid-associated multifunctional protein that is capable of condensing |CITS:[10982869]| and supercoiling DNA |CITS:[16384714][15853876][11282470][8306968]|. It is a global transcriptional silencer of genes with high AT content |CITS:[15100692][18387844]|, regulates 5% of all <i>Escherichia coli</i> genes |CITS:[11298273]|, and plays a key role in global chromosome organization in bacteria |CITS:[21903814]|. This protein acts as a pleiotropic transcriptional factor with a strong preference for horizontally acquired genes among the 250 loci to which it binds |CITS:[2126011][17046956]|. H-NS functions almost exclusively as a transcriptional repressor, although there is no clear evidence that this regulator is an activator. Currently, no inducer for this regulator has been reported in the literature, although Reush et al. proposed that this regulator can form a complex with a short chain of polyhydroxybutyrate |CITS:[12220682]|. Additional genes might be identified by high-throughput analysis |CITS:[19151137]|.<br>H-NS plays an important role in the regulation of many genes in response to environmental changes and adaptation to stress; therefore, it is  capable of controlling its own synthesis |CITS:[7934818][8830277]|. It also regulates transcription of many other genes that  participate in a variety of cellular functions, including genes involved in the following processes or responses: biogenesis of flagella |CITS:[8071234][10601207][11872702]|, transcription control of the type I fimbria structural genes |CITS:[9922259][9352908][9595659][7510658][9749677]|, acid resistance  |CITS:[16204188]|, the functional glutamic acid-dependent system |CITS:[10383761]|, osmotically inducible genes |CITS:[9663683]|, the glutamate decarboxylase-dependent acid resistance system |CITS:[15795232][12446650][11976288][11298273]|, osmotic control |CITS:[8120010][11673423]|, the type II secretion pathway |CITS:[11118204]|, carbon sources |CITS:[2160266]|, genes involved in the RNA component of the small subunit (30S subunit) |CITS:[9632265][15686546]|,  and proteases |CITS:[16143461]|, among others. It has also been shown to be involved in survival during stationary phase, conferring to the bacteria a growth advantage during stationary phase (GASP) |CITS:[22843842]|. A lack of H-NS results in overexpression of <i>ycdT</i>, <i>ydeH</i>, <i>yeal</i>, <i>yeaJ</i>, <i>yaiC</i>, <i>csgD</i>, <i>iraP</i>, and <i>ydiV</i>, while expression of <i>fliA</i> is decreased. These results indicate that H-NS influences motility via multiple regulatory linkages that include, minimally, the messenger molecule cyclic di-GMP, the biofilm regulatory protein CsgD, and the sigma factors &sigma;<sup>S</sup> and &sigma;<sup>F</sup>, thus impacting motility through diverse regulatory pathways |CITS:[ 26195595]|.<br>H-NS is capable of inducing severe bends in the DNA, interacting with a large number of DNA regions that contain a planar curvature |CITS:[2126011][1745240][14627810]|. It has been suggested that H-NS binds strongly to sites carrying a 10-bp AT-rich consensus sequence, which functions as a nucleation site for the formation of a repressive higher-order nucleoprotein complex |CITS:[17881364][19740756]|. H-NS binds to intergenic regions as well as regions within genes, but not all genes that bind H-NS are affected by this protein, a fact that is in agreement with the primary role assigned to HN-S in maintenance of nucleoid structure. Currently, there are different models for the formation of DNA-H-NS-DNA bridges which show that this protein binds in tandem to sequences in the genome, forming multimers |CITS:[15853876][17191074][16879983]|.<br>As expected for a gene involved in the modulation of many cellular processes, the expression of <i>hns</i> is regulated by several systems and at different levels. At the transcription level, <i>hns</i> is autoregulated, and it is controlled by different transcription factors. <i>hns</i> is induced by high hydrostatic pressure |CITS: [8226663]| and DNA synthesis |CITS:[8596450]|. At the posttranscriptional level, it is subject to regulation by the sRNAs Hfq and DsrA |CITS:[11115103][12554874][15814430][15147838][12753181]|.<br>It is a DNA-binding protein with similarity to StpA |CITS:[7961433][1480493]| and these two proteins can have similar functions |CITS:[10515926][10947847]|. It has an approximately fivefold-lower affinity for DNA than StpA and has a major preference for curved DNA |CITS:[11278075]|.  StpA appears to be a backup for Hns in the regulation of a set of nonessential and recently acquired genes |CITS:[23661089]|.<br>Expression of <i>stpA</i> from a plasmid can complement an <i>hns</i> mutant phenotype and StpA is able to repress and activate a subset of H-NS-regulated genes, but the specific mechanisms remain to be determined |CITS:[7961433][11278075][8890170][8635467][19151137][8890170]|. A dominant negative form of StpA can disrupt H-NS activity and vice versa, and H-NS can interact with StpA at two distinct domains to form heterodimers in vitro; also, there is evidence that these proteins can form homodimers |CITS:[11244076][8755860][10203842][8755860]|. For this reason, in the absence of H-NS the StpA protein is rapidly degraded in a Lon protease-dependent manner |CITS:[11244076][10485902]|; protection from proteolytic degradation appears to be mediated by a direct interaction between StpA and H-NS |CITS:[11244076]|. On the other hand H-NS also may form heterotrimeric complexes with Hha and YdgT |CITS:[17116239][15458420]|. It was proposed that Hha enhances the oligomerization of Hns/StpA which is necessary to form DNA-protein filaments to repress transcription |CITS:[23543115][23601147]|. The high-resolution structure based on solid-state NMR spectra from full-length H-NS has been determined |CITS:[23601147]|. <br>H-NS is a small protein and it is an abundant nucleic acid protein in the genome, with about 20,000 copies per cell. This regulator belongs to the histone-like family of transcriptional regulators and the structure of the protein consists of two structured domains which are separated by a flexible linker |CITS:[15100692]|. The N-terminal domain is required for oligomerization and it  is involved in protein-protein interactions, while the purified C-terminal domain is involved in DNA binding |CITS:[15100692][10203842][8755860][15063845][19740756]|. The cooperative binding of H-NS to DNA is related to protein-protein interactions |CITS:[24275506]|.<br>H-NS forms two compact clusters associated with each copy of the chromosome. These clusters are located near the one-quarter and three-quarter positions along the long axis of the cell |CITS:[21903814]|. In cells with three clusters, the additional cluster tends to appear in the middle |CITS:[21903814]|. The two cluster formations are induced by the N-terminal domain-driven oligomerization of the protein |CITS:[21903814]|. H-NS sequesters the regulated genes and operons into these clusters and juxtaposed numerous DNA segments broadly distributed throughout the chromosome |CITS:[21903814]|. Wang et al. (2011) reported that H-NS clusters could thus serve as anchoring points for numerous DNA loci distributed throughout the genome, creating DNA loops connecting the anchored loci |CITS:[21903814]|. <br>It was found that the promoter islands, which are regions of DNA containing multiple transcription start sites, are recognized and inactivated by HNS. These promoter islands are associated with genes acquired horizontally |CITS:[23717391]|.<br>Based on ChIP-chip and chip-seq analysis, it was proved that Rho-dependent termination abrogates the H-NS-DNA interactions, leading to transcriptional derepression of H-NS-silenced genes |CITS:[24499790]|.<br>An <i>hns</i>-<i>stpA</i> double mutant displayed slow growth and resulted in high expression of otherwise-silent horizontally acquired genes |CITS:[25429971]|.<br>Several mutations in the &sigma;<sup>38</sup> (RpoS) factor, as well as a duplication of ~40% of the genome centered around the origin of replication, converge in partially redressing the transcriptional imbalance of a strain lacking the H-NS/StpA gene-silencing system. The above finding suggests a possible role for &sigma;<sup>38</sup> in transcription of many H-NS targets |CITS:[25429971]|.<br>Reviews: |CITS:[16879983][17191074][15853876][9513262][15100692][12753181]|.

The activity of each protein is induced by different signals: the activity of Rob is increased with dipyridyl, bile salts, or decanoate |CITS:[11844771][12791142]|, and the activities of MarA and SoxS are increased by the aromatic weak acid salicylate |CITS:[11395452]| and oxidative stress |CITS:[8955629]|, respectively. SoxS was induced by tellurite (TeO<sub>3</sub><sup>2-</sup>) in a DNA microarray analysis  |CITS:[25049169]|.<br> <br>Many genes are regulated by all three proteins; however, some genes are regulated by only one of them. The differential regulation of these genes might be caused by the degeneracy of their DNA-binding sites |CITS:[14594836]|.<br>SoxS, MarA, and Rob bind as monomers to the same DNA site, a degenerate 20-bp sequence known as the Mar-Sox-Rob box, which has to be in a specific orientation and distance relative to the  -35 and  -10 boxes of the promoter |CITS:[10564485][10564484]|. In class I promoters, the activators bind upstream of the  -35 box and are generally oriented in the backward direction, while in class II promoters the proteins overlap the  -35 promoter hexamer and generally are oriented in the forward direction |CITS:[10564485][10564484]|. As a subset of the class I promoters, the Mar-Sox-Rob box is separated by ~30 bp from the  -10 hexamer but can be functional in either orientation |CITS:[10564485][10564484]|.<br>The Mar-Sox-Rob box contains an  invariant A  at position 1, two recognition elements, the RE1 at position 4-7 and RE2 at position 15-18, and a 7-bp A/T-rich spacer separating these elements |CITS:[10802742][11724537][11401718]|. There are more than 10,000 such binding sites per genome |CITS:[11866462]|. However, the majority of these sites are not functional because they are not in the proper orientation or distance relative to the promoter |CITS:[11985714]|. It was proposed that these proteins bind to their target sites by a mechanism named  DNA scanning  or  prerecruitment.  In prerecruitment, the protein first binds to RNA polymerase in solution, and the binary complex then scans the DNA to find its binding sites |CITS:[11985714][11866462]|. It has been shown that SoxS binds to the C-terminal domain of the &alpha;-subunit of RNA polymerase (&alpha;-CTD), in particular, it interacts with amino acid residues lying in or near the DNA-binding determinant of &alpha;-CTD. Apparently, SoxS functions as a co-sigma factor and redirects RNA polymerase to promoters carrying a SoxS-binding site |CITS:[15465042]|. <br>A new interaction that also occurs via prerecruitment between &sigma;<sup>70</sup> R4 of RNA<br>polymerase (RNAP) and SoxS has been identified |CITS: [20595001]|. There is evidence for the<br>existence of two types of interactions between SoxS and &sigma;<sup>70</sup> R4, with one type being able to occur  off-DNA  (within a SoxS-RNAP binary complex that scans the chromosome for SoxS-dependent promoters) and with the other one occurring  on-DNA  (within a SoxS-RNAP binary complex residing at a SoxS-dependent promoter) |CITS: [20595001]|. SoxS is now the first example of an <i>Escherichia coli</i> transcriptional activator that uses a single positive control surface to make specific protein-protein contacts with two different subunits of RNAP |CITS: [20595001]|. In class I promoters, the &sigma;<sup>70</sup> R4 region binds to the -35 box and SoxS binds upstream of the hexamer, but in class II promoters SoxS binds to the -35 box,  occluding the binding of &sigma;<sup>70</sup> R4 |CITS:[ 21195716]|.<br>SoxS, MarA, and Rob belong to the AraC/XylS family of transcriptional regulators |CITS:[9409145]| and, like other members of this family, they have two helix-turn-helix (HTH) motifs for DNA binding: one of them, located in the N-terminal region, interacts with the element RE1 of the Mar-Sox-Rob box, and the HTH located in the C-terminal region interacts with the element RE2 |CITS:[12217688][9724717][11724537]|.<br><i>soxS</i> is divergently transcribed from <i>soxR</i> |CITS:[1708380]|. SoxR is the transcriptional activator for <i>soxS</i> and a sensor for superoxide and nitric oxide through its [2Fe-2S] center. It activates <i>soxS</i> transcription when oxidized |CITS:[8816757][9204707]|. <i>soxS</i> is regulated only by its intracellular concentration. Upon removal of the inducer, SoxS is degraded by the Lon protease |CITS:[15009903]|. The binding of SoxS with DNA or RNA polymerase protects it from degradation |CITS:[16460757]|.<br>Transcriptomic and statistical modeling analyses with Zn concentration shifts showed a transient change in the activity of the iron regulator Fur and of the oxidative stress regulator SoxS; these findings suggest a competitive binding mechanism for the physiology of Zn and Fe uptake |CITS:[22016571]|.<br>Reviews: |CITS:[15667299][11145103][10963327][8955629]|. <br>	Local Regulator		aTGGCACaaaaagctAAAca

ECK120011383	Lrp	12	inverted-repeat	AsnC		ECK12	Lrp,  <b>L</b>eucine-responsive <b>r</b>egulatory <b>p</b>rotein,  is a dual transcriptional regulator for at least 10% of the genes in <i>Escherichia coli</i> |CITS:[12374860]|. These genes are involved in amino acid biosynthesis and catabolism, nutrient transport, pili synthesis, and other cellular functions, including 1-carbon metabolism |CITS:[1346534][12675791][7968922]|. In addition, Lrp affects nearly three-fourths of the genes induced upon entry into stationary phase |CITS:[12374860][19052235]|. Lrp might also play a topological role in dynamic DNA packaging |CITS:[8212136]|.<br>Lrp can act as a repressor or activator for its target genes. Binding of leucine can affect these activities in three different ways: leucine either potentiates, antagonizes, or has no discernible effect upon Lrp action |CITS:[1532173][8432705][8561478]|. It is believed that Lrp senses the presence of rich nutrition based on the concentration of leucine and positively regulates genes that function during famine and negatively regulates genes that function during a feast |CITS:[7968922]|.<br>Lrp forms a mixture of octamers and hexadecamers |CITS:[11575919]|. In the presence of leucine the octamer configuration is favored. It is believed that the switch between the octameric and hexadecameric states modulated by leucine affects the binding and the activity of Lrp at its target genes |CITS:[12054800]|. The structure of Lrp from <i>Escherichia coli</i> bound to DNA as an octamer has been solved |CITS:[17223133]|. Lrp forms an open ring structure, in which the DNA is wrapped around the octamer in a nucleosome-like structure. The monomer chain contains two domains, an N-terminal helix-turn-helix motif and a C-terminal &alpha;&beta;-sandwich fold. <br>Lrp-regulated promoters commonly contain multiple adjacent binding sites for the protein with low sequence specificity. A consensus recognition sequence has been described |CITS:[8636076]|. The identified 15-bp sequence motif is structured with flanking CAG/CTG triplets and a central AT-rich signal. Leucine has two effects upon binding to DNA <i>in vitro</i>: the affinity of Lrp is reduced but the cooperativity of binding to multiple sites is increased |CITS:[15571719]|.<br>Lrp belongs to the Lrp/AsnC family of transcriptional regulatory proteins, which is widely distributed throughout the eubacterial and archaeal domains. Lrp appears to be very well conserved in members of the &gamma;-proteobacteria |CITS:[12675791]|.	Global Regulator	Sensing external and internal signals

The integration host factor facilitates control of the <i>psp</i> regulon |CITS: [9302010][9344746][15485810]|.<br>The <i>psp</i> regulon is defined like the phage shock protein system, which is involved in protecting the bacterium during infectious processes |CITS: [15485810][8606168]|. The synthesis of this regulon is induced when <i>Escherichia coli</i> is grown under different extracytoplasmic stress conditions and upon infection by filamentous phage (phage shock) |CITS: [1717346][16709570][9159513][16045608][16045605][1712397][9493373]|. <br>The activity of PspF is inhibited by PspA, which is an accessory protein that binds directly to PspF to inhibit transcription of the <i>psp</i> regulon |CITS: [12079332][1717346]|. PspA inhibits PspF activity by direct interaction of the AAA+ transcription activation domain of PspF |CITS: [12079332]|. Although PspA appears to regulate transcription of the <i>psp</i> regulon, it does not bind to DNA , but it is necessary for repressing this regulon |CITS: [10629175]|. <br>PspA appears to bind to the W56 loop of PspF, which is a region that contains residues 50-62. This loop contains a group of three amino acids, called the YLW patch, that serve as a docking site for PspA and for ATP hydrolytic activity |CITS: [ 23659791]|. The PspF-PspA complex is mainly located in the nucleoid; however, this complex is able to frequently travel from the nucleoid to the membrane to sense changes in the membrane that result from some types of stress |CITS: [23764692]|.<br>On the other hand, PspB and PspC together act cooperatively to activate transcription of the <i>psp</i> regulon by blocking the interaction between PspA and PspF |CITS: [1717346][7596833]|. PspC is essential for this activation, whereas PspB is not strictly required |CITS: [1717346]|. PspA, PspB, and PspC form a complex, and PspC is required for PspA to bind to PspB |CITS: [12562786]|. PspA, PspB, and PspC are not observed to cross-link with PspD |CITS: [12562786]|. <br>The PspF AAA+ domain interacts with &sigma;<sup>54</sup> in the presence of a compound that mimics the transition state of ATP hydrolysis |CITS: [11544185]|.

Detailed analysis of the role of the C7 and the C3 regions of PspF has been presented with respect to ATP hydrolysis, protein oligomerization, binding to the &sigma;<sup>54</sup> holoenzyme, and transcription activation |CITS: [12186874]|. <br>A conformational change in PspF is observed in the presence of ATP |CITS: [12186874]|. ATPase activity may result in transient presentation of the site that interacts with &sigma;<sup>54</sup> |CITS: [12601152]|. Steps leading to open complex formation at the promoter have been examined using PspF and various nucleoside analogs |CITS: [12649285]|. <br>Expression of <i>pspF</i> is negatively autoregulated |CITS: [9150200][8606168][9260970][9302010][9344746]|. The stability of <i>pspF</i> mRNA is enhanced by a RIB element (bacterial interspersed mosaic element) in the 3'-flanking region of the <i>pspF</i> transcript |CITS: [9150200]|.<br>The PspF protein belongs to the enhancer-binding protein family of &sigma;<sup>54</sup>-dependent activators (bEBPs). PspF is composed of two domains: the N-terminal catalytic domain, common to members of the AAA+ protein family (ATPase associated with various cellular activities), and a C-terminal helix-turn-helix DNA-binding domain |CITS: [8606168]|. PspF does not contain a regulatory domain typical for other bEBP proteins; instead, its activity is negatively controlled by PspA acting in <i>trans</i> |CITS: [10629175][15838051][12079332]|.  The mechano-chemical coupling in bEBPs requires distinct activities of the AAA+ subunits |CITS: [25063294]|.<br>The catalytic AAA+ domain is necessary and sufficient to activate &sigma;<sup>54</sup> transcription <i>in vivo</i> and <i>in vitro</i>. Hexamerization is required for this function and does not require ATP, DNA, or the DNA-binding domain |CITS: [9878422][15111053][16973614][14659000]|. When assembled into a ring, the AAA+ domain uses the energy from ATP binding, hydrolysis, and product release to remodel the &sigma;<sup>54</sup>-RNA polymerase holoenzyme so that it can transition from the closed to the open complex. The AAA+ domain contains all conserved motifs of the AAA+ family, including Walkers A and B for ATP binding and hydrolysis, and the second region of homology (SRH), which contains arginine fingers for intersubunit catalysis |CITS: [11473577][6329717][18208391]|. As a member of the bEBP family it carries two additional sequence insertions: the L1 loop containing the GAFTGA motif and the L2 loop (also termed the pre-SIi loop). The L1 loop is known to interact with &sigma;<sup>54</sup>, presumably with region I of &sigma;<sup>54</sup>. Zhang et al. (2012) showed that L1 is multifunctional, since it interacts with three elements important for isomerization from RP<sub>c</sub> to RP<sub>o</sub> (the RNAP closed and open complexes, respectively). On one hand, L1 contacts the DNA nontemplate strand immediately upstream of the -24 promoter element, and on other hand, it contacts two PspF L1-binding sites, residues 18 to 25 and 33 to 39, within &sigma;<sup>54</sup> RI |CITS: [22772990]|. The GAFTGA motif is thought to communicate changes associated with ATP hydrolysis, leading to conformational rearrangements in the RNA polymerase closed complex and thereby promoting open complex formation |CITS: [17090527][15469519][19692583][12601152]|. The L2 loop is thought to coordinate movement of the L1 loop |CITS: [19486295][17242399]|. <br>Based on an engineered single-chain polypeptide, it was shown that the PspF hexamer functions asymmetrically, i.e., the individual subunits make different contributions to the activities of the oligomer, and only three subunits are necessary for engagement and remodeling of the target (&sigma;<sup>54</sup>) of the closed complex (RP<sub>c</sub> formation) |CITS: [21300807]|.<br>Reviews: |CITS: [18023171][16531068][16045608][9159513]|<br>	Local Regulator		gTaGtgAAaTtCAccAc

They activate a common set of  genes,  but the expression and activity of each one of these proteins are induced by different signals: the activity of  Rob is increased with dipyridyl, bile salts, or decanoate |CITS: [11844771] [12791142]|, and  the transcription of MarA and SoxS is increased by the aromatic weak acid  salicylate |CITS:[11985714]| and oxidative stress |CITS:[ 8955629]|, respectively.<br>Many genes are regulated by all three proteins; however, some genes are regulated only by one of them.  The differential regulation of these genes might be caused by the degeneracy of their DNA-binding sites |CITS:[ 14594836]|.<br>These three monomer proteins bind to the same DNA site, a degenerate 19-bp sequence known as the sox-mar-rob box, which has to be in a specific orientation and distance  relative to the -35 and -10 boxes of the promoter |CITS:[10564485] [10564484]|.  In class I promoters, the activators bind upstream of the -35 box and are generally oriented in a backwards direction, while in class II promoters the proteins overlap the -35 promoter hexamer and generally are oriented in the forward direction |CITS:[10564485] [10564484]|. In a subset of the class I promoters the sox-mar-rob box is separated by ~30 bp from the -10 hexamer but can be functional in either orientation |CITS:[10564485] [10564484]|.<br>For MarA it was shown that the extent of activation at different promoters is only poorly correlated with the strength of MarA binding to the specific mar box |CITS:[18514222]|. By using a computational model of transcriptional activation it was proposed that at the class I promoter of <i>mar</i> MarA increases the binding of RNA polymerase but not the occupancy. At the class II promoters of <i>sodA</i> and <i>micF</i> MarA can even decrease both RNA polymerase affinity and occupancy at the promoter. The model predicts that MarA increases the rate of transcription initiation while decreasing the overall presence of the transcription machinery at the promoter |CITS:[20019803]|.<br>The sox-mar-rob box contains an  invariant A  at position 1,  two recognition elements, the RE1 at postion 4-7 and RE2 at position 15-18, and a 7-bp  A/T-rich spacer separating these elements |CITS: [10802742][11724537][ 11401718]|. There are more than 10,000 such binding sites per genome |CITS:[11866462]|. However, the majority of these sites are not functional because they are not in the proper orientation or distance relative to the promoter |CITS:[11985714]|. Based on these findings, it was proposed that these proteins activate the transcription by a mechanism named  DNA scanning  or  prerecruitment,  which consists of the formation of the complex  RNA polymerase transcriptional regulator in the absence of DNA, and then this complex scans the DNA to bind to appropriate sites |CITS:[11985714][11866462]|.<br>These three proteins belong to the AraC/XylS family of transcriptional regulators |CITS:[ 9409145]|,  and as with other members of this family they have two helix-turn-helix  (HTH) motifs for DNA binding, one of them, located in the N-terminal region, interacts with the element RE1 of the mar box, and the HTH located in the C-terminal region interacts with the element RE2 |CITS:[12217688][ 9724717][11724537]|. In the case of Rob, it appears that only one of two HTH motifs makes base-specific contact with DNA; this was observed for the micF promoter |CITS:[10802742]|.<br>Cells carrying a MarA mutation in a glutamic acid residue (E89A) were able to express higher resistance to superoxides than those harboring wild-type MarA |CITS:[21097628]|. Thus, MarA E89A acts more like SoxS than MarA in exhibiting greater activation and binding at the class I promoter |CITS:[21097628]|.<br><i>marA</i> is the second gene of the <i>marRAB</i> operon, which encodes an autorepressor (MarR) and an autoactivator (MarA) |CITS:[ 8383113]|.

This protein regulates the expression of the operons that encode components of a secondary pathway of iron-sulfur cluster assembly, iron-sulfur proteins, anaerobic respiration enzymes, and biofilm formation |CITS:[11432781][11742080][16677314][18849427][16824106][19074392]|.<br>IscR is a member of the Rrf2 family |CITS:[19361432]| and carries a predicted N-terminal helix-turn-helix DNA-binding motif and three conserved cysteines in its C terminus.

This [2Fe-2S]<sup>1+</sup> cluster has an unusual (Cys)<sub>3</sub>(His)<sub>1</sub> ligand scheme and is essential for cluster ligation |CITS:[22583201]|. Some proteins, such as SufB, IscU, EprA, and IscA, are involved in the assembly and transfer of the [2Fe-2S]cluster to IscR |CITS:[23320508]|<br>Two types of DNA-binding sites have been described for IscR: type 1 and type 2. Both sites resemble 25-bp imperfect palindromes but differ in their sequence |CITS:[16677314][19361432]|. IscR requires the iron-sulfur cluster for its activity when bound to type 1 sites. The binding of the [2Fe-2S]<sup>1+</sup> cluster allows IscR to induce a conformational change, mainly around the residue Glu43, that modifies its DNA-binding affinity. This modification enables IscR to bind to type 1 DNA-binding sites  |CITS:[ 23644595]|.<br> P<sub>iscR</sub> contains two type 1 sites |CITS:[16677314]|. Therefore, under conditions when Fe-S cluster assembly becomes rate limiting, levels of [2Fe-2S]-containing IscR may decrease due to a lower rate of its synthesis, thus relieving repression of the <i>iscRSUA</i> operon for the biogenesis of the iron-sulfur cluster |CITS:[11742080][11752417][23075318]|. In contrast, for the regulation of promoters containing type 2 sites, such as P<sub><i>sufA</i></sub>, the [2Fe-2S] cluster of IscR is dispensable |CITS:[16824106][18849427]|.<br>IscR binds cooperatively to DNA, and four protomers bind to one palindromic site |CITS:[19361432]|.<br>	Local Regulator		ATAcccGAcTAAAtTAcTCgGgTAT

ECK120011502	NarL	16	asymmetric	LuxR/UhpA		ECK12	NarL,  nitrate/nitrite response regulator NarL,  is a transcriptional dual regulator of many anaerobic electron transport and fermentation-related genes in the response to the availability of high concentrations of nitrate or nitrite |CITS:[9230919][7855431]|. NarL activates expression of 51 operons in response to nitrate, mostly genes needed for nitrate respiration. NarL represses 41 operons involved in alternative respiratory pathways, such as fumarate reduction or fermentation of simple sugars |CITS:[ 16377617]|.<br>The response regulator NarL belongs to the LuxR/UhpA family |CITS:[2559300][2314271]| and is part of the two-component system NarX-NarL. There is intensive cross-regulation with the paralogous two-component system NarQ-NarP |CITS:[12546643][8501030]|. Each of the sensors, NarX and NarQ, is able to phosphorylate NarL and NarP, leading to the activation of both proteins. In the absence of nitrate and nitrite, NarX and NarQ stimulate the dephosphorylation of NarL-P and NarP-P |CITS:[8051011][8473280]|. This reaction is specific, that is, NarL-P is only desphosphorylated by NarX. The system discriminates between nitrate and nitrite. In the presence of nitrate both sensors phosphorylate NarL and NarP to the same extent. In the presence of nitrite, NarX phosphorylates NarP but acts primarily as a phosphatase for NarL-P |CITS:[9426129][9006026][10464202]|. In contrast, NarQ phosphorylates NarL and NarP in response to both nitrate and nitrite. Therefore, NarL mainly serves as a nitrate regulator and is only weakly phosphorylated in the presence of nitrite |CITS:[10464202][10542156]|.<br>NarL consists of the N-terminal receiver domain and a C-terminal DNA-binding domain. The crystal structures of the monomeric full-length protein |CITS:[8780507][9521685]| and of the dimeric output domain bound to DNA |CITS:[12352954][16262254]| have been solved. In unphosphorylated NarL, the DNA-binding site of the output domain is blocked by the receiver domain |CITS:[8780507]|. Phosphorylation induces the separation of both domains, resulting in the exposure of previously inaccessible DNA-binding residues and the formation of a new dimerization interface in the C-terminal domain |CITS:[12484754][12614149]|.<br>The receiver domain of NarL and NarP could function as a stabilizer of the carboxyl-terminal domain (CTD); it enhances DNA binding and/or enables repression per se <i>in vivo</i>. In addition, the receiver may make protein-protein contacts necessary for transcription activation |CITS:[20634237]|.<br>The NarL consensus recognition sequence consists of a 7-bp element, termed the NarL heptamer |CITS:[8437517][8736541]|. A subset of NarL-binding sites, in which two inverted repeats of the heptamer are separated by 2 bp (termed 7-2-7 sites), also represents binding sites for NarP |CITS:[9302020][7854119]|. Therefore, the NarL and NarP regulons overlap. NarL-binding heptamers are found as single copies, inverted repeats, or direct repeats at positions between +20 and -200 relative to the transcriptional start sites |CITS:[7643383]|. Most NarL-dependent promoters are also codependent on the oxygen sensor FNR, IHF, or Fis, implying that multiprotein complexes are involved in the transcriptional regulation of NarL target promoters |CITS:[16936015][9484902][10972841][15225315][11929525]|.<br>The Nar sites are classified based on the location of the activator binding site (ref). Nar class I promoters have a single Nar-binding site immediately adjacent to the promoter |CITS:[17720788][19245365][16199562]|, and Nar class II promoters have two Nar-binding sites upstream of the promoter |CITS: [20634237]|and reference therein|.

When PaaX is overexpressed, it causes elevated levels of mutations in the genome; therefore, it is a candidate to regulate DNA replication, recombination, or repair |CITS: [15225322]|. <br>PaaX contains a helix-turn-helix motif for DNA binding that is similar to the motif found in the N terminal of members of the GntR family of transcriptional regulators |CITS: [9748275]|. Members of this family share similar N-terminal DNA-binding domains but are classified into four subfamilies according to their divergence in their C-terminal domains, which are involved in effector binding and oligomerization |CITS: [11756427]|.<br>Homology with PaaX has been found in other bacteria, such as <i>Pseudomonas putida</i>, <i>Bacillus halodurans</i>, and <i>Arthrobacter</i> sp., among others |CITS: [10766858]|.<br>The majority of work concerning PaaX has been done in <i>E. coli</i> W, in which has been found the DNA-binding sites for PaaX, including a site upstream of the <i>paaXY</i> operon |CITS: [15159386]|. The DNA-binding consensus of PaaX consists of a palindromic sequence of 6 bp separated by about 27 bp |CITS: [15159386][16788190]|. This palindromic property of the PaaX site as well as the presence of a helix-turn helix motif in the protein have been the basis for suggestions that PaaX binds DNA as a dimer |CITS: [10766858][15159386]|.<br>The binding of PaaX to DNA is inhibited by phenylacetyl-CoA, which is the product of the first catabolic step in PA degradation |CITS: [10766858][9748275]|.<br><i>paaX</i> is transcribed in an operon (<i>paaXY</i>) that is located in the genome downstream and in the same orientation as the <i>paaABCDEFGHIJK</i> operon, which is repressed by PaaX |CITS: [10766858]|.<br>Crystal structures of the transcriptional repressor PaaX have been determined |CITS: [22102047]|.

B1500 is the connector protein for the PhoPQ two-component system, which is involved in acid resistance and Mg<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis |CITS:[17998538]|. YdeO is an AraC-like transcriptional activator for at least 12 operons, including the <i>gadE-mdtE-mdtF</i> operon |CITS:[19329985][19329985][12694615][11282467]|. <i>mdtEF</i> encodes a multidrug efflux pump, and <i>gadE</i> encodes the master regulator for glutamate-dependent acid resistance |CITS:[12940989][19220752]|. GadE activates transcription of two additional AraC-like transcriptional activators, GadX and GadW. The EvgA-YdeO-GadE circuit is very complex and involves feedback loops and autoactivation |CITS:[15489450][19352034][17660422]|. It is activated during exponential growth in acidified minimal medium and enables the cell to survive gastric acidity.<br>EvgA belongs to the two-component system EvgS/EvgA |CITS:[1289796]|, which is highly homologous to the virulence-related BvgAS system of <i>Bordetella pertussis</i>. The sensor kinase EvgS carries an N-terminal periplasmic domain and three cytoplasmic domains, a transmitter, a receiver, and a phosphotransfer (HPt) domain. EvgA is a member of the NarL subfamily of response regulators, consisting of an N-terminal receiver domain and a C-terminal helix-turn-helix DNA-binding domain. Like BvgA, EvgA presumably is phosphorylated in a phosphorelay reaction that involves phosphotransfer from the autophosphorylated transmitter domain to the receiver and Hpt domain of EvgS and finally to the receiver domain of EvgA |CITS:[9501520][11111905][9535079]|.<br>An 18-bp inverted repeat motif was proposed as the EvgA DNA-binding site |CITS:[12399493][14523115]|.<br>	Local Regulator	External-Two-component systems	TTCCTACAgcTGTAaGAA

ArgR is also essential for a site-specific recombination reaction that resolves plasmid ColE1 multimers to monomers and is necessary for plasmid stability |CITS[3149585]|. The role of ArgR in this latter reaction may be structural |CITS[3149585]|.<br>The hexamer is the active form of ArgR, and L-arginine binds to ArgR and stabilizes the hexamer |CITS:[ 8594204]|and increases its DNA affinity by allosteric activation |CITS:[ 8594204][15663926 ]|.<br>ArgR belongs to the ArgR/AhrC family, whose members are widely distributed in bacteria |CITS:[11305941]|.

ECK120012029	PutA	6	asymmetric	PutA		ECK12	PutA is a flavoprotein with mutually exclusive functions as a transcriptional repressor and membrane-associated enzyme.  The switch between the two activities is due to conformational changes triggered by proline binding.  In the presence of proline, PutA is associated with the cytoplasmic membrane and acts a bifunctional enzyme catalyzing both reactions of the proline degradation pathway: the oxidation of proline by proline dehydrogenase and subsequent oxidation to glutamate by pyrroline-5-carboxylate (P5C) dehydrogenase.  In the absence of proline, PutA is cytoplasmic and functions as a transcriptional repressor of the <i>put</i> regulon.  <br>The N-terminal 47 residues with a ribbon-helix-helix fold contain the dimerization domain and the specific DNA-binding activity of PutA <a title="15155740, 18586269, 22013066" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Gu D,2004.

In the absence of proline, PutA binds to operator sequences in the <i>putA</i>-<i>putP</i> intergenic region and represses transcription, most likely by keeping RNA polymerase from binding to the <i>putA</i> promoter <a title="18586269" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Zhou Y,2008</a>.<br>The proline dehydrogenase activity resides in the amino-terminal 669 amino acids of PutA; a truncated protein retains proline dehydrogenase and DNA-binding activity but lacks membrane association and 1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate dehydrogenase activity <a title="12009917" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Vinod MP,2002</a>.

UlaR activity is also controlled by homotypic tetramer-dimer transitions regulated by L-ascorbate-6-P |CITS:[18844374]|. <br>UlaR binds to four inverted repeat motifs in the divergent intergenic region <i>ulaG</i>-<i>ulaA</i> and overlaps its target promoters to repress transcription by blocking the interaction of the RNA polymerase with <i>ulaG</i>p and <i>ulaA</i>p |CITS:[14996803]|. Here, the presence of L-ascorbate-6-P breaks this configuration down into DNA-free UlaR homodimers and allows transcription to proceed |CITS:[18844374]|. At concentrations of >2 nM, L-ascorbate-6-P displaces UlaR from its operator site |CITS:[18844374]|.<br>In this system the full repression of the <i>ula</i> regulon requires IHF and binding of UlaR to four operator sites, possibly involving UlaR-mediated DNA loop formation |CITS:[14996803]|. <br>The UlaR transcriptional repressor belongs to the DeoR family, and accordingly, this transcriptional repressor family protein is composed of two domains: an N-terminal HTH domain (residues 1-62), which contains the DNA-binding region |CITS:[12374842]|, and the C-terminal sugar-phosphate-binding domain (residues 69-251), which is responsible for dimerization and inducer binding |CITS:[16376935]|.

The dimer is composed of two identical six-helical subunits, where four of the helices intertwine with the corresponding helices from the other subunit. Binding of tryptophan stabilizes the HTH and alters the orientation of the HTH such that the repressor fits into the major grooves |CITS:[3600756]|.<br>The crystal structure of the repressor-operator complex reveals that specific binding is mostly mediated by contacts to the phosphate backbone and water-mediated hydrogen bonds, suggesting that the intrinsic DNA structure rather than the specific base pairs are recognized, a mechanism which has been termed indirect readout |CITS:[3419502]|.

MelR binds to the less-conserved site (-42.5) with less strength; this binding occurs only in the presence of melibiose, and it is absolutely required for expression of <i>melA</i>p |CITS:[10760178]|. MelR binding to the distal site (-237.5) has been shown to down-regulate the expression of <i>melR</i>p and <i>melA</i>p |CITS:[16621812][10760179]|. <br>In the absence of melibiose, MelR is unable to activate <i>melA</i>p, but it regulates its own expression by repressing <i>melR</i>p and <i>melA</i>p simultaneously |CITS:[10760178][11752325][9409145]|. Melibiose triggers MelR-dependent activation of <i>melA</i>p and relieves MelR-dependent repression of <i>melR</i>p |CITS:[9409145][11752325]|. The <i>melAB</i> operon is located upstream of <i>melR</i> and in the opposite direction.<br>This regulator belongs to the AraC/XylS family of activators and occurs as both a monomer and a homodimer. It is composed of two domains: the carboxy-terminal domain, which contains the DNA-binding region, and the amino-terminal domain, which is responsible for dimerization and l-arabinose binding |CITS:[7784205][2684786][1445207][9108148][12675795]|. <br>	Local Regulator	Sensing external and internal signals	ATTCCCATAAACTCAGAT

It also regulates the expression of small riboregulators |CITS: [17557827]|.<br>LrsR pertains to the quorum-sensing system, which involves autoinducer-based bacterial cell-to-cell communication |CITS: [8288518]|.  It was demonstrated in Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium that LsrR directly senses and binds the molecule 4,5-dihydroxy-2,3-pentanedione (DPD), phosphorylated |CITS: [17274596]| and dephosphorylated |CITS: [17557827]|. Distinct forms of DPD constitute the interconverting molecules family generally called autoinducer 2 (AI-2). The binding of DPD to LsrR inactivates LsrR, but phosphorylated DPD appears to specifically inactivate the action of LsrR on the expression of genes for autoinducer 2 uptake and processing (lsrACDBFG-tam operon) and lsrR itself |CITS: [17557827]|. On the other hand, it was suggested that dihydroxyacaetone phosphate inhibits binding of DPD to LsrR |CITS: [15601708]|.<br>The structure of the LsrR protein has been analyzed in crystallography and mutational analysis studies, where it was observed that it contains two main domains, the DNA-binding domain located in the N terminus and a ligand-binding domain around the C terminus |CITS: [23589368]|.<br>This protein binds to DNA as a tetramer to regulate transcription; however, in the presence of phosphorylated autoinducer 2 (AI-2) or ADP-P, the tetramer dissociates into dimers, and the interaction of LsrR with DNA is greatly reduced |CITS: [23589368]|.<br>The structure of LsrR as a tetramer was determined via exclusion chromatography and cross-linking assays |CITS: [23589368]|. The crystal structure of the LsrR protein complexed with the native signal (phosphor-Al-2, D5P) was determined |CITS:[24047255]|. D5P is converted into its hydrated form to create strong H-bonds with the carboxyl group of D243 |CITS:[24047255]|.<br>The lsrR gene is transcribed together with lsrK in an operon |CITS: [16321939]|, and this last gene encodes a protein that phosphorylates to DPD |CITS: [14622426]|.

The homeostasis of different metals in the cell is constantly monitored, and adequate pathways are activated or repressed to keep the metals within normal levels. Specifically, when nickel and cobalt exceed the normal levels, cell growth stops |CITS:[16956381]|. <br>The <i>rcnR</i> gene is encoded divergently to the <i>rcnA</i> gene, which encodes an efflux protein that is involved in nickel and cobalt homeostasis |CITS:[15805538]|; it removes an excess of ions |CITS:[16956381]|. It has been proved by Koch and colleagues |CITS:[17120142]| that the <i>rcnR</i> gene is the target of Fur regulation in regard to iron levels (when iron increases, <i>rcnR</i> expression increases about 2.3-fold |CITS:[17120142]|). <br>An RcnR structure study showed that it has a charged N-terminal region (amino acids 1-34), followed by a highly conserved region of primarily nonpolar amino acids (35-64), that is, probably involved in binding metals. The N terminus determines metal-specific responses in the recognition of cognate and noncognate metals |CITS:[22471551]|. Its secondary structure prediction shows three helices without any &beta;-sheet |CITS:[16956381]|. <br>RcnR is not similar to any other known transcriptional regulator; instead, it is homologous to other proteins whose genes are encoded next to genes encoding putative metal efflux proteins, metalloenzymes, or copper chaperones [and just a few (13%) of the homologs to cardiolipin synthases or membrane proteins] |CITS:[16956381]|. Such conserved localization with genes of metal-related functions suggests that these homologs are likely to play a regulatory role in metal homeostasis |CITS:[16956381]|. <br>RcnR acts as a transcriptional repressor for its divergent <i>rcnA</i> gene |CITS:[16956381]| and a weak repressor for its own expression |CITS:[19703465]|. In response to increasing concentrations of nickel or cobalt, RcnR releases the repression of <i>rcnA</i> and <i>rcnR</i> to allow its expression |CITS:[16956381][19703465]|. As <i>rcnR</i> expression is induced in response to iron even in the absence of Fur |CITS:[17120142]|, it is possible that RcnR responds to iron ions directly. <br>RcnR binds to two sites in the <i>rcnA-rcnR</i>  intergenic region with the sequence TACT-G(6)-N-AGTA |CITS:[19703465][16956381]|. The TACT inverted repeats are critical for specific binding. The G-tracts provide a structural component to facilitate binding of RcnR to DNA, because they endow A-form DNA characteristics to the RcnR operators. In addition, RcnR interacts nonspecifically with the approximately 50 bp flanking the core binding site, resulting in DNA wrapping and the introduction of a single negative supercoil into plasmid DNA |CITS:[19703465]|. RcnR forms a stable tetramer and binds as a tetramer to one operator. The tetrameric state is not perturbed by Ni(II) or Co(II) binding |CITS:[18505253]|. <br>As nickel levels depend on the Nik uptake system (NikR regulator, NikABCDE transporter) and nickel is highly used during anaerobic growth by the Ni-Fe hydrogenase isozyme, the additional participation of RcnR and RcnA in nickel homeostasis changes the previous understanding of the cell's nickel processing. Iwig and colleagues |CITS:[16956381]| showed that RcnR is not directly related to other proteins that use nickel, although they showed that RcnA, as the exporter of excess ions, has direct participation. RcnA likely competes with NikR for nickel ions at low concentrations, and in such a way RcnA downregulates <i>nikABCDE</i> expression and nickel uptake (for this, <i>rcnA</i> must be expressed at a basal level prior to induction, as observed with higher nickel levels) |CITS:[16956381]|. Also, RcnA is important in the modulation of the hydrogenase assembly pathway through the NikR regulation that limits nickel delivery to the process, repressing <i>nikABCDE</i> transporter expression when intracellular nickel levels are high |CITS:[16956381]|.<br>Reviews: |CITS:[22970729]|.

ECK120034476	DpiA	23	inverted-repeat	HTH_11		ECK12	CitB/DpiA is a dual transcriptional regulator involved in anaerobic citrate catabolism. In the presence of citrate and under anaerobic conditions it activates genes for citrate fermentation, the <i>citCDEFXGT</i> operon, the <i>citAB</i> operon, and <i>mdh</i>, as well as the <i>exuTR</i> operon for dissimilation of hexuronate |CITS:[18997424]|. <br>Due to the ability of CitB/DpiA to bind to A/T-rich sequences, multiple other roles have been assigned to CitB. When overexpressed in <i>E. coli</i>, it destabilizes plasmid inheritance, represses transcription of <i>appY</i>, encoding a regulator of anaerobic metabolism, and induces the SOS response by competing with DnaA and DnaB in binding to A/T-rich sequences at the replication origin |CITS: [9701802][14526013]|. Moreover, inactivation of penicillin-binding protein 3, FtsI, either chemically or genetically, induces SOS in <i>E. coli</i>. This induction requires <i>dpiBA</i> |CITS:[15308764]|. <br>CitB/DpiA belongs to the two-component system DpiB/DpiA, or CitBA. The operon containing both genes, <i>citB</i> (<i>dpiA</i>), encoding the response regulator, and <i>citA</i> (<i>dpiB</i>), encoding the sensor kinase, is transcribed divergently to the <i>citCDEFXGT</i> operon. CitA (DpiB) binds citrate with its periplasmic domain |CITS:[11889485]| and senses reduced conditions using a single Cys residue <i>in vitro</i> |CITS:[19202292]|. The cytoplasmic domain is involved in autophosphorylation and phosphotransfer to CitB (DpiA) |CITS:[19202292]|. Therefore, it has been suggested that the main role of DpiA/CitB is regulation of citrate fermentation |CITS:[11889485]|.<br>CitB/DpiA shows 47% similarity to the CitB protein from <i>K. pneumoniae</i>, which also controls the citrate fermentation process |CITS:[9701802]|. Like CitB from <i>K. pneumoniae</i>, CitB/DpiA from <i>E. coli</i> contains a helix-turn-helix DNA-binding motif in the C-terminal domain and three well-conserved residues, two aspartates (positions 13 and 57) and one lysine (position 107), in the N-terminal domain |CITS: [9701802]|.

NemR belongs to the TetR family of HTH-type DNA-binding transcription factors |CITS:[16397293][15556475]|.<br>NemR binds to a region 16 bp in length, and its consensus is a palindromic sequence, TAGACCnnnnGGTCTA, which is referred as the NemR box |CITS:[18567656]|. This box sequence, TAGACCnnnnGGTCTA, is close to the recognition sequence, TTGACCAnnTGGTCAA, of RutR (the RutR box). RutR can bind upstream of the <i>nemRA</i> operon; however, it does not play an important role in regulation of <i>nemRA</i> expression <i>in vivo</i> |CITS:[18567656]|.<br>Presently, the <i>nemRA</i> operon is the unique member of the NemR regulon. Based on genomic SELEX and gene expression analyses, NemR could be affecting other genes, such as <i>ydhF-ydhL, gloA, sapABCDF, yeaU, pck  yeaT</i>, and <i>yhgE</i> |CITS:[18567656]|; however, the regulation of the genes under control of NemR requires more detailed studies before it can be solved.<br>The NemRA system plays an important role in <i>Escherichia coli</i> survival in the presence of the toxic compound <i>N</i>-ethylmaleimide (NEM), which is the inducer for depression of the <i>nemRA</i> operon |CITS:[18567656]|. It has been experimentally verified that methylglyoxal (MG) and not NEM is the real inducer for the <i>nemRA</i> operon |CITS:[23646895]|. This induction was determined by ChIP-chip analysis with DNA-RNAP occupancy when cells were exposed to growth-inhibitory concentrations of MG |CITS:[23646895]|. NemR is a transcriptional repressor that is sensitive to HOCl and related reactive chlorine species (RCS), and its gene products contribute to increased bleach resistance by detoxifying reactive electrophiles produced during this process |CITS:[23536188]|.<br>The NemR regulator is controlled by alkylation of one or more of its Cys residues. NemR contains five Cys residues, at positions 70, 78, 88, 121, and 125, in a total of 199 residues. In some of these residues, NemR is controlled by alkylation |CITS:[18567656]|. On the other hand, Lee et al. (2013) reported that NemR contains six cysteines located at residue positions 21, 98, 106, 116, 149, and 153 |CITS:[23506073]|. The critical Cys residue(s) involved in NemR activity control remains to be identified |CITS:[18567656]|. However, the cysteines at positions 21 and 116 have been determined as essential in sensing electrophiles <i>in vivo</i> and <i>in vitro</i> |CITS:[23506073]|. The Cys-106 residue, which is conserved among NemR homologs, has been identified as a trigger for the NemR RCS-sensing mechanism |CITS:[23536188]|. NemR is  a redox-regulated transcriptional repressor, since it uses the oxidation status of HOCl-sensitive cysteine residues to respond to bleach and related reactive chlorine species (RCS) |CITS:[23536188]|.

In addition, YefM also functions as an antitoxin to form a complex with YoeB, which is a toxin that is counteracted by YefM antitoxin |CITS:[17170003]|. YefM can bind alone with low affinity to the <i>yefM-yoeB</i> operator, but together with YoeB it has an enhanced DNA-binding affinity compared to free YefM |CITS:[17170003]|. YoeB enhances the interaction with YefM by affecting the YefM conformation to one that is more favorable for DNA binding and/or by stabilizing the nucleoprotein complex at the operator site and reducing basal expression of the <i>yefM-yoeB</i> operon |CITS:[17170003][19028895]|.<br>The <i>yefM</i> gene is upregulated during growth in biofilms |CITS:[14727089]| and <i>yefM-yoeB</i> is upregulated in persister cells |CITS:[16768798]|; it is probable that derepression of <i>yefM-yoeB</i> autoregulation occurs in these circumstances in response to an as-yet-unknown environmental or cell cycle signal(s) that interferes with the YefM-YoeB-operator interaction |CITS:[19028895]|.<br>The operator site 5' of <i>yefM-yoeB</i> comprises adjacent long (L) and short (S) palindromes with core 5'-TGTACA-3' motifs with a center-to-center distance of 12 bp |CITS:[17170003]|,  which was suggested to be  crucial for the correct stable positioning of YefM-YoeB at the two repeats |CITS:[19028895]|. This sequence organization is common in <i>yefM-yoeB</i> regulatory regions in diverse genomes, suggesting that interaction of YefM-YoeB with these motifs is a conserved mechanism of operon autoregulation |CITS:[17170003]|.<br>Nevertheless, YefM originally was described as a native unstructured protein |CITS:[14672926]|; later it was reevaluated as experimental, and modeling data have demonstrated that the protein is at least partially folded |CITS:[17170003][11735370]| and dimeric |CITS:[17170003]|.<br>The YefM antitoxin forms a heterotrimeric complex with the YoeB toxin (YefM<sub>2</sub>-YoeB) |CITS:[15980067][16109374]|. The tertiary structure of the YoeB toxin and the YefM<sub>2</sub>-YoeB complex has been described |CITS:[16109374]|. In the complex, one C terminus in the YefM homodimer is unfolded and the other one shows an &alpha;-helical conformation and conceals the endoribonuclease fold of YoeB. Two N-terminal segments of YefM form a symmetrical dimer within the YefM<sub>2</sub>-YoeB heterotrimeric complex and do not contact YoeB directly |CITS:[19028895]|.<br>YefM does not possess a canonical DNA-binding motif, but instead a pair of basic residues, R10 and R31, conserved in many YefM homologs are absolutely necessary for DNA binding by the YefM-YoeB complex |CITS:[12603745][19028895][ 16109374]|.

It regulates several genes upon hypochlorite stress, which increases cellular viability by reducing the intracellular iron levels |CITS: [22223481]|. This assumes a primary role for HypT in downregulating iron acquisition genes in order to prevent further synthesis of iron uptake proteins |CITS: [22223481]|.<br>HypT is specifically activated by HOCl by methionine oxidation, protecting the cells from the detrimental effects of HOCl) |CITS: [22223481]|. HypT belongs to the large family of LTTRs and is conserved in &alpha;-, &beta;-, and &gamma;-proteobacteria and eukaryotes (<i>Xenopus tropicalis</i>), which suggests conservation of the HOCl response in evolution and its maintenance throughout the kingdoms |CITS: [22223481]|.<br>Based on microarray analysis, HypT upregulates genes involved in cysteine and methionine biosynthesis and sulfur metabolism upon hypochlorite stress. On the other hand, genes involved in iron acquisition and homeostasis upon hypochlorite stress are downregulated by YjiE |CITS: [22223481]|.<br>HypT has five cysteine residues which contribute to control the DNA-binding activity of HypT <i>in vitro</i> |CITS: [24116067]|. Cys150 is required for stability, Cys4 is important for oligomerization of HypT to dodecamers, and Cys4 oxidation may be a checkpoint in the activation process of HypT |CITS: [24116067]|.<br>The building block of HypT is likely a dimer; similar to other LTTRs, it forms unusually large oligomers, as dodecameric ring-like structures, <i>in vitro</i> that undergo large DNA-induced conformational changes to form dimers and tetramers |CITS: [22223481]|. Studies based on the dynamic oligomers showed that oxidized small HypT oligomers (tetramers) are the activation-competent species, whereas the docameric ring-like structures are the storage form |CITS: [24275662]|.<br>In the presence of hypochlorite, HypT becomes active due to oxidation of three methionines (Met123, Met206, and Met230). A probable conformational change upon oxidation allows the protein to bind DNA to regulate transcription.

It is composed of an N-terminal CheY-like receiver domain and a C-terminal LytTR-like effector domain with DNA-binding affinity |CITS:[23222720]|.<br>YpdB binds to two direct repeats of the motif GGCATTTCAT, separated by an 11-bp spacer, in the <i>yhjX</i> promoter |CITS:[23222720]|.<br>Based on genome scanning and microarray analysis, it has been determined that <i>yhjX</i> is the sole target gene regulated by the YpdA/YpdB system, and it is modulated by the sequence-dependent structure of the surrounding DNA |CITS:[23222720]|.<br>Based on microarray analyses of <i>Escherichia coli</i>, 2,3-butanedione (2,3-BD) and glyoxylic acid (GA), volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emitted from <i>Bacillus subtilis</i>, mediated global changes in gene expression related to motility and antibiotic resistance phenotypes that affected the expression of more than 100 genes |CITS:[23651997]|. These changes were mediated by YpdB through the regulation of the transcription factors SoxS, YjhU, and the RpoS sigma factor, which were increased by treatment with (2,3-BD) |CITS:[23651997]|. <br>YpdB is required for biofilm formation, and it is induced by VOCs |CITS:[16000817][23651997]|.<br>The expression of <i>hipA</i> was severely reduced in the <i>ypdB</i> knockout, which suggests that the <i>ypdB</i> gene product might function as an upstream activator or transcription factor for <i>hipA</i> expression |CITS:[23651997]|. <br><br>The YpdA/YpdB two-component system is widespread among proteobacteria and show a high degree of conservation in gammaproteobacteria |CITS:[23203871]|.<br>The YpdA/YpdB system stimulates expression of the <i>yjiY</i> gene, the target of the YehU/YehT system, which suggests an interconnectivity between the two systems |CITS:[24659770]|. YpdA/YpdB is activated during growth in an amino acid-rich milieu, such as LB medium. It responds to extracellular pyruvate |CITS:[24659770]|.<br>YehU/YehT and YpdA/YpdB two-component systems are activated and expression of the corresponding target genes was found to occur at the same time as the onset of the stationary phase |CITS:[24659770]|.<br><i>In vivo</i> studies detected crosswise stimulus-dependent alterations in the expression of their respective target genes, and mutational analyses revealed that deletion of any of the components of the signal transduction cascade affects the function of the other. On the other hand, <i>in vivo</i> protein-protein interaction assays suggested that both systems together form a single large signaling unit |CITS:[24659770]|.<br>Activation of the YehU/YehT signaling cascade, which results in YjiY production, suppresses YpdA/YpdB-mediated <i>yhjX</i> induction, whereas activation of the YpdA/YpdB signaling cascade, as well as inducing the synthesis of YhjX, promotes expression of <i>yjiY</i> |CITS:[24659770]|.<br>	Local Regulator	External-Two-component systems

ECK125160661	PuuR	20	inverted-repeat	HTH_3		ECK12	PuuR is a transcription repressor that regulates transcription of several genes and operons involved in putrescine utilization and transport |CITS:[15590624][22522900]|. Transcription of <i>puuA</i> was induced in a <i>puuR</i> deletion mutant |CITS: [18495664]|.<br>This regulator is comprised of two domains: the carboxy-terminal domain, which is similar to cupin superfamily proteins, and the amino-terminal domain, which has high similarity to regulators of the HTH-XRE family |CITS:[22522900]|.<br>Nemoto et al. showed that this regulator binds to four target sites in the divergent region located between the operons <i>puuA</i> and <i>puuDR</i>. Its regulator represses transcription by overlapping the promoters <i>puuA</i>p and <i>puuD</i>p, and the binding targets for PuuR consist of 15 nucleotides, with the following recognition sequence: AAAATATAATGAACA |CITS:[22522900]|.<br>The transcription of the <i>puu</i> genes occurs when putrescine interacts with PuuR; this effect changes the conformation of PuuR, and its regulator dissociates from the binding sites. When the level of putrescine decreases in the cell, PuuR can repress the transcription of <i>puu</i> genes |CITS:[22522900]|.<br>	Local Regulator		
ECK125162247	RclR		inverted-repeat	AraC/XylS		ECK12	RclR (formerly YkgD) is a redox-sensitive transcriptional activator that belongs to the AraC family, whose highly conserved cysteine residues are highly specifically sensitive to oxidation by reactive chlorine species (RCS)|CITS: [24078635]|.<br>RclR relies on the reversible oxidation of conserved redox-sensitive cysteine residues to specifically sense RCS and control the expression of genes essential for survival under reactive chlorine (HOCl) stress |CITS: [24078635]|.<br>RclR is activated by <i>N</i>-chlorotaurine, and that activation may involve formation of one disulfide bond. RclR contains two conserved cysteine residues (Cys-21 and Cys-89) and two conserved histidine residues (His-42 and His-75). Cys-21 and Cys-89 are important in the activation of RclR <i>in vivo</i>. Cys-21 could play the more critical role in the RclR redox response. Oxidation of both cysteines leads to strong, highly specific activation of expression of genes required for survival under RCS stress. The His residues are involved in preventing DNA binding when RclR levels are reduced |CITS: [24078635]|.<br>RclR homologs are found in a variety of proteobacteria as well as in a few actinobacteria |CITS: [24078635]|.<br>RclR:  <b>r</b>eactive <b>c</b>h<b>l</b>orine resistance <b>R</b>  |CITS: [24078635]|	Local Regulator
